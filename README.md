# App Design Document

## App Name
Mystery-Museum

## Plan
My plan for the final project is to make an app dedicated to my Minecraft mods and make it as unique and vivid as possible. i will be including all of the mods I have made up to this point along with ones still in development and future ideas.

As for sortment, I would first start off filing them in groups such as Still in Development, Gen 1, and Gen 2. Then I would make a View All button to show all along with a search bar to make it easier to locate. This would all be on the title page.

Images, videos, and download links will be included along with information about the mod and step-by-step instructions on how you would install the mod in Minecraft.

## Problem Statement
Modding in Minecraft has been around for a long time to the point where it is now part of the game itself. It serves as a creative space for those with endless ideas and as a learning platform for aspiring programmers. Minecraft mods introduce new entities or gameplay mechanics that make the main game a whole lot more interesting and entertaining.

## Target Users
Minecraft Players
Mod Creators

## Core Features
The app will be mobile friendly with pressable buttons. The goal is to make the app as user-friendly as possible. A search bar will be implemented to make it easier to find certain mods. Possibly a drop down menu will be added to the site. Additional features will be added.

## User Interaction Flow:
1. The user opens the app which leads to the featured screen.
2. From there, they will have the option to choose from multiple groups of mods or just view all of them.
3. Click on a mod to view it.
4. The user can browse the details (images, videos, etc.) and can choose to download it.

## Components:
App
Header
ItemList
ItemCard

## State and Data:
Data will consist of a list of items as well as an array of task objects.

## Stretch Goals:
If time aallows it, additional features I would add would be an about me screen, possibly links to other Minecraft mod websites such as Planet Minecraft and MCPEDL. Maybe some fun features like a spin the wheel.
